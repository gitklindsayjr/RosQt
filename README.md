# RosQt

This repository contains all the code necessary to use QtCreator version 5.5 and ros-kinetic. The example connects to the ros publisher "joy" joy_node.

In addition their is a rosserial interface that connects to a publisher, "msp432_pub", runing on a MSP432401R. That publisher was part of the repository "MicroControllers/ROS_MSP432_Red/RosInterface".

Refer to setup.txt for instructions.
